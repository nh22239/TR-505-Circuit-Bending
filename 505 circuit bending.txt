R82 - distortion in whole mix, 2.2k in parallel
IC6,7,8 - crazy drum sound bends, patchbay? test them
IC14 - distort individual drums by connecting pin 16 (Vcc, be careful)

Body contact - R46 to IC11 pins 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 24, 23, 21, 19

Individual outputs - C28-C35 potentiometer across the existing resistors

pitch mod - R39, place 1k pot across

IC1 RAM chip - CAREFUL, stuttering, connect any IC1 pin to IC3 pins, patch bay?
