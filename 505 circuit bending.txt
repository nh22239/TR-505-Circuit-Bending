R82 - distortion in whole mix, replace with a pot?

drum sound bends - IC5,6,7,8 patchbay? test them, decide how many patches

IC14 - distort individual drums by connecting pin 16 (Vcc, be careful, maybe skip)

Body contact - R46 to IC11 pins 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 24, 23, 21, 19 (contact points)

Individual outputs - C28-C35 potentiometer across the existing resistors

pitch mod - R39, place 1k pot across

sequencer glitches - IC1 RAM chip - CAREFUL, stuttering, connect any IC1 pin to IC3 pins, patch bay?

individual pitch controls - 40106 hex inverter clock to IC9
